# Apto Health Insurance Platform

## Problem Statement

In the current healthcare insurance claim process, patients face a cumbersome and opaque procedure when submitting their medical and lab test bills for insurance claims. The process involves multiple stakeholders, including hospital and lab administrations, and requires manual verification and approval, leading to inefficiencies and delays. The lack of transparency and real-time updates further complicates the patient's experience.

## Solution

Our Apto Health Insurance Platform revolutionizes the traditional claim process by leveraging blockchain technology for seamless and transparent operations. Here's how it works:

1. **Patient Portal**: Patients log in to the platform to upload their medical and lab test bills, initiating the claim process. Notifications are automatically dispatched to the respective hospital and lab administrations for further action.

2. **Hospital and Lab Admin Verification**: The hospital and lab administrators log in to their respective portals to review and verify the submitted bills. Upon verification, they approve the bills, and this approval is immutably recorded on the blockchain via smart contracts.

3. **Smart Contract Automation**: The smart contract awaits approvals from both the hospital and lab administrations. Once both approvals are received, it automatically notifies the insurance administrator, signaling that the claim is ready for the final review.

4. **Insurance Admin Finalization**: The insurance administrator accesses a consolidated view of hospital and lab approvals on the blockchain. This transparency enables the administrator to efficiently calculate the claim amount and finalize the claim, ensuring a swift and accurate process.
